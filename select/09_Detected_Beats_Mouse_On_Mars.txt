The breath remains
The source of some detected beats
Of each and every measure

The breath remains
The end of word and gesture
Blows out the light of leaving

Sensing us the ones retrieving

The breath remains
The source of some detected beats
The breath remains

Sensing us the ones retrieving

The source of some detected beats
Of each and every measure
The breath remains
The source of some detected beats
